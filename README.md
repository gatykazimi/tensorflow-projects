# Cat vs Dog
The fcc_cat_dog.ipunb file is a Jupyter notebook that has an ML model using Tensorflow and keras. 
To increase accuracy, I used more layers and nodes in my model, augmented my training data to minimize

After training my model, I plotted the relationship between training and validation accuracy with epoch number and training and validation
loss with epoch number. This shows that the higher the epoch number, the accuracy is maximized and the loss is minimized.
